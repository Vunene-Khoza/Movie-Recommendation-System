A sophisticated **content-based movie recommendation system** built with **machine learning** and deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**.

---

## üåü Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on plot, genre, and movie characteristics  
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Beautiful, responsive Streamlit web application  
- **Movie Posters**: Integration with **TMDb API** for high-quality movie posters  
- **Smart Search**: Fuzzy matching for movie titles  
- **Similarity Scoring**: Shows how closely matched each recommendation is  
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on desktop and mobile devices

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will open in your browser at:
http://localhost:8501


# üß† How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing

Combines movie overview, genre, and title into "tags"
Cleans and preprocesses text data
Handles missing values

2. Feature Extraction

Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization
Converts text into numerical vectors
Creates a feature matrix of 10,000+ movies

3. Similarity Calculation

Computes cosine similarity between all movie pairs
Creates a 10,000 x 10,000 similarity matrix
Enables fast recommendation lookup

4. Recommendation Generation

Finds the input movie in the dataset
Retrieves similarity scores for all other movies
Returns top N most similar movies

üìä Dataset
The model is trained on The Movie Database (TMDb) dataset containing:

10,000+ movies
Movie titles, overviews, genres
Release dates, ratings, and popularity scores
Unique movie IDs for API integration
